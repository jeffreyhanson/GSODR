Stations are individually checked for number of missing days to assure data quality, stations with too many missing observations are omitted. All units are converted to metric, e.g. feet to metres and Fahrenheit to Celcius. Output is saved as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file summarizing each year by station, which includes vapor pressure and relative humidity variables calculated from existing data in GSOD.\r\n\r\nThis package was largely based on Tomislav Hengl's work in \"[A Practical Guide to Geostatistical Mapping](http://spatial-analyst.net/book/getGSOD.R)\", with updates for speed, cross-platform functionality and some added functionality.\r\n\r\nBe sure to have disk space free and allocate the proper time for this to run. This is a time, processor and disk space intensive process.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the description of the data provided by NCDC, http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt.\r\n\r\n## To install this package\r\n### Stable release from CRAN\r\nA stable release of GSODR is available on CRAN.\r\n\r\n`install.packages(\"GSODR\", dep = TRUE)`\r\n\r\n### Development version from GitHub\r\nIf you wish to install the development version that may have new features (but also may not work properly), install the devtools package, available from CRAN.\r\n\r\n`install.packages(\"devtools\")`\r\n\r\nUse `install_github(\"author/package\")` to install this package.\r\n\r\n`devtools::install_github(\"adamhsparks/GSODR\")`\r\n\r\n## Using get_GSOD()\r\nSee `?get_GSOD()` for the help file.\r\n\r\n## Function description\r\nThis package consists of a single function, get_GSOD(), which generates a \r\n.csv file in the respective year directory containing the following variables:  \r\n**STNID** - Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location;  \r\n**WBAN** - number where applicable--this is the historical \"Weather Bureau Air\r\nForce Navy\" number - with WBAN being the acronym;  \r\n**STATION NAME** - Unique text identifier;  \r\n**CTRY** - Country;  \r\n**LAT** - Latitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are <-90 or >90 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**LON** - Longitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are <-180 or >180 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**ELEV.M** - Elevation converted to metres. *Station dropped where ELEV is NA*;  \r\n**YEARMODA** - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format;  \r\n**YEAR** - The year;  \r\n**MONTH** - The month;  \r\n**DAY** - The day;  \r\n**YDAY** - Sequential day of year (not in original GSOD);  \r\n**TEMP** - Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing =\r\n-9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.TEMP** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily\r\ntemperature;  \r\n**DEWP**-  Mean daily dewpoint converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing =\r\n-9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.DEWP** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew point;  \r\n**SLP** - Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths. Missing = -9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.SLP** - Number of observations used in calculating mean sea level\r\npressure;  \r\n**STP** - Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths\r\nMissing = -9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.STP** - Number of observations used in calculating mean station pressure;  \r\n**VISIB** - Mean visibility for the day converted to kilometers to tenths\r\nMissing = -9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.VISIB** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily\r\nvisibility;  \r\n**WDSP** - Mean daily wind speed value converted to metres/second to tenths\r\nMissing = -9999.99;  \r\n**COUNT.WDSP** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily windspeed;  \r\n**MXSPD** - Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day converted to\r\nmetres/second to tenths. Missing = -9999.99;  \r\n**GUST** = Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to metres/second to\r\ntenths. Missing = -9999.99;  \r\n**MAX** - Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to\r\ntenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will\r\nsometimes not be the max for the calendar day. The \"*\" flag is dropped. *In\r\ninstances where MAX < MIN, both MAX and MIN are set to Missing.*\r\nMissing = -9999.99;  \r\n**MIN**- Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celcious to\r\ntenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will\r\nsometimes not be the max for the calendar day. The \"\\*\" flag is dropped. *In\r\ninstances where MAX < MIN, both MAX and MIN are set to Missing.*\r\nMissing = -9999.99;  \r\n**PRCP** - Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day\r\nconverted to millimetres to hundredths;   will usually not end with the\r\nmidnight observation--i.e., may include latter part of previous day. .00\r\nindicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = -9999.99.\r\n*Note:  Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation--\r\ntherefore, '-9999.99' will often appear on these days. For example, a\r\nstation may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain\r\nfell.* See FLAGS.PRCP column for source of data;  \r\n**FLAGS.PRCP** -  \r\nA = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nB = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nC = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nD = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nE = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nF = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nG = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nH = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports),\r\nbut also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly\r\nobservations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered\r\nas incomplete data for the day;  \r\nI = Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not report any\r\noccurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible\r\nthat precip occurred but was not reported;  \r\n**SNDP** - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths. Missing = -9999.99;  \r\n**INDICATOR** - (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day\r\nof:  \r\nFOG,  \r\nRAIN or drizzle,  \r\nSNOW or ice pellets,  \r\nHAIL,  \r\nTHUNDER,  \r\nTORNADO or funnel cloud;  \r\n\r\n### Values calculated by this package:\r\n**ea** - Mean daily actual vapour pressure;  \r\n**es** - Mean daily saturation vapour pressure;  \r\n**RH** - Mean daily relative humidity;  \r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nUsers of these data should take into account the following (from the NCDC\r\nwebsite): \r\n> The following data and products may have conditions placed on their international commercial use.
