Stations\r\nare individually checked for number of missing days to assure data\r\nquality, stations with too many missing observations are omitted. All\r\nunits are converted to metric, e.g., inches to milimetres and Fahrenheit to\r\nCelsius. Output is saved as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file or ESRI\r\nformat shapefile summarizing each year by station, which includes vapor\r\npressure and relative humidity variables calculated from existing data\r\nin GSOD.\r\n\r\nThis package was largely based on Tomislav Hengl's work in \"[A Practical\r\nGuide to Geostatistical\r\nMapping](http://spatial-analyst.net/book/getGSOD.R)\", with updates for\r\nspeed, cross-platform functionality, and more options for data\r\nretrieval and error correction.\r\n\r\nBe sure to have disk space free and allocate the proper time for this to\r\nrun. This is a time, RAM and disk space intensive process. For any query\r\nof GSOD data other than a single station, the process runs in parallel\r\nto clean and reformat the data.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the description of the data provided by NCDC,\r\n<http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt>.\r\n\r\nTo install this package\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n### Stable release from CRAN\r\n\r\nA stable release of GSODR is available on CRAN.\r\n\r\n``` r\r\ninstall.packages(\"GSODR\", dependencies = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development version from GitHub\r\n\r\nIf you wish to install the development version that may have new\r\nfeatures (but also may not work properly), install the devtools package,\r\navailable from CRAN.\r\n\r\n``` r\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\", dependencies = TRUE)\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"adamhsparks/GSODR\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis package consists of a single function, `get_GSOD()`, which generates\r\na .csv file or ESRI format shapefile in the respective year directory\r\ncontaining the following variables:  \r\n**STNID** - Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location;  \r\n**WBAN** - number where applicable--this is the historical \"Weather\r\nBureau Air Force Navy\" number - with WBAN being the acronym;  \r\n**STN.NAME** - Unique text identifier;  \r\n**CTRY** - Country;  \r\n**LAT** - Latitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are &lt;-90\r\nor &gt;90 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**LON** - Longitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are &lt;-180\r\nor &gt;180 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**ELEV.M** - Elevation converted to metres.  \r\n**ELEV.M.SRTM.90m** - Elevation in metres corrected for possible errors,\r\nsee Notes for more;  \r\n**YEARMODA** - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format;  \r\n**YEAR** - The year;  \r\n**MONTH** - The month;  \r\n**DAY** - The day;  \r\n**YDAY** - Sequential day of year (not in original GSOD);  \r\n**TEMP** - Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths.\r\nMissing = -9999;  \r\n**TEMP.CNT** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily\r\ntemperature;  \r\n**DEWP**- Mean daily dewpoint converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing\r\n= -9999;  \r\n**DEWP.CNT** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew\r\npoint;  \r\n**SLP** - Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths.

Missing = -9999;  \r\n**GUST** - Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to\r\nmetres/second to tenths. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**MAX** - Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to\r\nCelsius to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region,\r\nso this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing =\r\n-9999;  \r\n**MAX.FLAG** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max\r\ntemp report and not from the 'hourly' data. \\* indicates max temp was\r\nderived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported\r\ntemperature);  \r\n**MIN**- Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to\r\nCelsius to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region,\r\nso this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing =\r\n-9999; ;  \r\n**MIN.FLAG** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max\r\ntemp report and not from the 'hourly' data. \\* indicates max temp was\r\nderived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported\r\ntemperature);  \r\n**PRCP** - Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during\r\nthe day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end\r\nwith the midnight observation--i.e., may include latter part of previous\r\nday. .00 indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).\r\nMissing = -9999; *Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no\r\nprecipitation-- therefore, '-9999' will often appear on these days. For\r\nexample, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during\r\nwhich rain fell.* See FLAGS.PRCP column for source of data;  \r\n**PRCP.FLAG** -  \r\nA = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nB = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nC = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nD = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nE = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nF = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nG = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nH = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg., from 6-hour\r\nreports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in\r\nhourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be\r\nconsidered as incomplete data for the day;  \r\nI = Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not\r\nreport any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's\r\nstill possible that precip occurred but was not reported;  \r\n**SNDP** - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**I.FOG** - Indicator for fog, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the\r\noccurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.RAIN\\_DZL** - Indicator for rain or drizzle, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not\r\nreported) for the occurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.SNW\\_ICE** - Indicator for snow or ice pellets, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not\r\nreported) for the occurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.HAIL** - Indicator for hail, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the\r\noccurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.THUNDER** - Indicator for thunder, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported)\r\nfor the occurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.TDO\\_FNL** - Indicator for tornado or funnel cloud, (1 = yes, 0 =\r\nno/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;\r\n\r\n### Values calculated by this package and included in final output:\r\n\r\n**ea** - Mean daily actual vapour pressure;  \r\n**es** - Mean daily saturation vapour pressure;  \r\n**RH** - Mean daily relative humidity;\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Elevation Values\r\n\r\n90m hole-filled SRTM digital elevation (Jarvis *et al.* 2008) was used\r\nto identify and correct/remove elevation errors in data for station\r\nlocations between -60˚ and 60˚ latitude. This applies to cases here\r\nwhere elevation was missing in the reported values as well. In case the\r\nstation reported an elevation and the DEM does not, the station reported\r\nis taken. For stations beyond -60˚ and 60˚latitude, the values are\r\nstation reported values in every instance.
