Stations are individually checked for number of missing days to assure data quality, stations with too many missing observations are omitted. All units are converted to metric, e.g. feet to metres and Fahrenheit to Celsius. Output is saved as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file or ESRI format shapefile summarizing each year by station, which includes vapor pressure and relative humidity variables calculated from existing data in GSOD.\r\n\r\nThis package was largely based on Tomislav Hengl's work in \"[A Practical Guide to Geostatistical Mapping](http://spatial-analyst.net/book/getGSOD.R)\", with updates for speed, cross-platform functionality. Now it's added and more options for data retrieval and error correction.\r\n\r\nBe sure to have disk space free and allocate the proper time for this to run. This is a time, RAM and disk space intensive process, however it does not require much processing power. \r\n\r\nFor more information see the description of the data provided by NCDC, [http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt](http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt).\r\n\r\n## To install this package\r\n### Stable release from CRAN\r\nA stable release of GSODR is available on CRAN.\r\n\r\n`install.packages(\"GSODR\", dep = TRUE)`\r\n\r\n### Development version from GitHub\r\nIf you wish to install the development version that may have new features (but also may not work properly), install the devtools package, available from CRAN.\r\n\r\n`install.packages(\"devtools\")`\r\n\r\nUse `install_github(\"author/package\")` to install this package.\r\n\r\n`devtools::install_github(\"adamhsparks/GSODR\")`\r\n\r\n# Output\r\nThis package consists of a single function, `get_GSOD()`, which generates a \r\n.csv file or ESRI format shapefile in the respective year directory containing the following variables:  \r\n**STNID** - Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location;  \r\n**WBAN** - number where applicable--this is the historical \"Weather Bureau Air\r\nForce Navy\" number - with WBAN being the acronym;  \r\n**STN.NAME** - Unique text identifier;  \r\n**CTRY** - Country;  \r\n**LAT** - Latitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are <-90 or >90 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**LON** - Longitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are <-180 or >180 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;  \r\n**ELEV.M** - Elevation converted to metres.  \r\n**ELEV.M.SRTM.90m** - Elevation in metres corrected for possible errors, see\r\nNotes for more;  \r\n**YEARMODA** - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format;  \r\n**YEAR** - The year;  \r\n**MONTH** - The month;  \r\n**DAY** - The day;  \r\n**YDAY** - Sequential day of year (not in original GSOD);  \r\n**TEMP** - Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing =\r\n-9999;  \r\n**TEMP.CNT** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily\r\ntemperature;  \r\n**DEWP**-  Mean daily dewpoint converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing =\r\n-9999;  \r\n**DEWP.CNT** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew point;  \r\n**SLP** - Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**SLP.CNT** - Number of observations used in calculating mean sea level\r\npressure;  \r\n**STP** - Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.

Missing = -9999;  \r\n**GUST** - Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to metres/second to\r\ntenths. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**MAX** - Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to\r\ntenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will\r\nsometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**MAX.FLAG** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max\r\ntemp report and not from the 'hourly' data. * indicates max temp was derived\r\nfrom the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);  \r\n**MIN**- Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to\r\ntenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will\r\nsometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = -9999;  ;  \r\n**MIN.FLAG** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max\r\ntemp report and not from the 'hourly' data. * indicates max temp was derived\r\nfrom the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);  \r\n**PRCP** - Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day\r\nconverted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end with the\r\nmidnight observation--i.e., may include latter part of previous day. .00\r\nindicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = -9999;\r\n*Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation--\r\ntherefore, '-9999' will often appear on these days. For example, a\r\nstation may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain\r\nfell.* See FLAGS.PRCP column for source of data;  \r\n**PRCP.FLAG** -  \r\nA = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nB = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nC = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nD = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nE = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nF = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nG = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;  \r\nH = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg., from 6-hour reports),\r\nbut also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly\r\nobservations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered\r\nas incomplete data for the day;  \r\nI = Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not report any\r\noccurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible\r\nthat precip occurred but was not reported;  \r\n**SNDP** - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths. Missing = -9999;  \r\n**I.FOG** - Indicator for fog, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence\r\nduring the day;  \r\n**I.RAIN_DZL** - Indicator for rain or drizzle, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported)\r\nfor the occurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.SNW_ICE** - Indicator for snow or ice pellets, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not\r\nreported) for the occurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.HAIL** - Indicator for hail, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the\r\noccurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.THUNDER** - Indicator for thunder, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the\r\noccurrence during the day;  \r\n**I.TDO_FNL** - Indicator for tornado or funnel cloud, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not\r\nreported) for the occurrence during the day;  \r\n\r\n### Values calculated by this package and included in final output:\r\n**ea** - Mean daily actual vapour pressure;  \r\n**es** - Mean daily saturation vapour pressure;  \r\n**RH** - Mean daily relative humidity;  \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n90m hole-filled SRTM digital elevation (Jarvis *et al.* 2008) was used to\r\nidentify and correct/remove elevation errors in data for station locations \r\nbetween -60˚ and 60˚ latitude. This applies to cases here where elevation was\r\nmissing in the reported values as well. In case the station reported an\r\nelevation and the DEM does not, the station reported is taken. For stations\r\nbeyond -60˚ and 60˚latitude, the values are station reported values in every\r\ninstance.
